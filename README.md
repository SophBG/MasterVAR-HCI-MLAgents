# ML-Agents Jumping Game

This project was created for an HCI course in my Master's program in Virtual and Augmented Reality (VAR).

It is a simple Unity game where a character must jump over obstacles that move toward it.  
In this version, the character is controlled using **Unity ML-Agents**.  
The agent was trained with PPO and uses ray sensors to detect obstacles and the ground.

The goal of the project was to explore interaction, behavior learning, and autonomous control in a basic unity environment.
